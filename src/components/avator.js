          In computing, an avatar (also known as a profile picture or userpic)
          is a graphical representation of a user or the user's character or
          persona. Avatar images have also been referred to as "picons"
          (personal icons) in the past, though the usage of this term is
          uncommon now. The term "avatar" can also refer to the personality
          connected with the screen name, or handle, of an Internet user.
